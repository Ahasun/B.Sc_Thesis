<h3>Title</h3> 
Multi-label Emotion Recognition: A Comparative Study </br>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
The number of people using the internet is growing every day. And these people
continually communicate their loves and dislikes, as well as all of their ideas,
through various texts on various online platforms, which we can also refer to as
emotions. And the information included in these consumersâ€™ feelings is crucial.
As a result, language has a wide range of uses, including constructing empathetic
chatbots to identify harmful online conduct, product evaluations, and artificial
intelligence (AI) to grasp the emotions portrayed in language. As a result,we have
chosen to identify the emotions in your work and rate it on a level of <strong>27</strong> emotions.We
employed a machine learning method for this. We employed  <strong> Multinomial Naive
Bayes, Linear SVC, SGD Classifier, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Multilayer
Perceptron as statistical classifiers.</strong> Decision Tree has the best F1 score of <strong>0.36</strong> out of
all of them. With an  F1 score of<strong> 0.34 </strong>, Multilayer Perceptron came in second. The
datasets were weighted using the TF-IDF method. We discovered that statistical
classifiers are still competent when compared to artificial neural networks in these
studies. </br>
